I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the AI Thrust at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/).
I recevied my Ph.D. degree from the [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Suhang Wang](https://suhangwang.ist.psu.edu/). I obtained my Master of AI degree from Computer Science Department at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/). I received my Bachelor Degree from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).

## Research Directions at <img src="../images/logo.svg" style="height: 2.5em; vertical-align: middle;">(Trust & Application AI Lab)

My recent research interests lie in the **Protein Foundation Model** and the **Visual Language Action (VLA) model**. Specifically, he believes that scientific discoveries in proteins can be reshaped by a system of: LLM Idea Propose <-> Protein Foundation Model Dry Experiments <-> Wet Experiments by Visual Language Action Model.
