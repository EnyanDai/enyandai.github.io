I am a final year Ph.D student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/) - University Park. My advisor is [Dr. Suhang Wang](https://suhangwang.ist.psu.edu/). I obtained my Master of AI degree from Computer Science Department at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/). I received my Bachelor Degree from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I am actively hinting positions in academia/industry.

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in data mining, Trustwortht Graph Learning, machine learning fairness, and robust machine learning.
